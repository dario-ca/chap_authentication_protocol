Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) RFC 1994

-authenticates a user or network host to an authenticating entity
-protection against replay attacks
-use of an incrementally changing identifier and of a variable challenge-value
-both the client and server know the plaintext of the secret, although it is never sent over the network
-provides better security as compared to Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
-scheme used by Point to Point Protocol (PPP) servers to validate the identity of remote clients
-periodically verifies the identity of the client by using a three-way handshake
-verification is based on a shared secret
1_After the completion of the link establishment phase, the authenticator sends a "challenge" message to the peer
2_The peer responds with a value calculated using a one-way hash function on the challenge and the secret combined
3_The authenticator checks the response against its own calculation of the expected hash value. If the values matches, the authenticator acknowledges the authentication; otherwise it should terminate the connection
4_At random intervals the authenticator sends a new challenge to the peer and repeats steps 1 through 3

IMPLEMENTATION:
-server+client
-client:
	-connects to server
	-separate thread handles CHAP:
		-save last challenge received
		-append secret to last challenge and hash them together
		-send to server
	-main thread send input to server
-server:
	-sets up port for connection
	-new thread handles CHAP:
		-just sends challenges periodically
	-main thread receives messages from client
		-if it is a message: prints
		-if it is a challenge: checks it
